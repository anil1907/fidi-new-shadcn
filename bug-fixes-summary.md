# Bug Fixes Summary

## 3 Critical Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug 1: Missing token-service.ts file (Compilation Error)

**File:** `src/lib/token-service.ts` (missing)
**Severity:** Critical
**Type:** Compilation Error

**Description:**
The `axios.ts` file imports `tokenService` from `./token-service` but this file doesn't exist, causing a compilation error that prevents the application from building.

**Impact:**
- Application fails to compile
- HTTP client functionality is broken
- Complete application failure

**Root Cause:**
Missing implementation of token service functionality that handles token storage, retrieval, and management.

**Fix:**
Created `src/lib/token-service.ts` with comprehensive token management:
- Token storage and retrieval methods
- Cookie-based token management
- Token expiration checking
- Proper TypeScript interfaces
- Server-side rendering safety checks

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `src/lib/token-service.ts`

### Bug 2: Missing refreshToken method in auth-service.ts (Runtime Error)

**File:** `src/lib/auth-service.ts`
**Severity:** High
**Type:** Runtime Error

**Description:**
The `axios.ts` file calls `authService.refreshToken()` but this method doesn't exist in the auth-service.ts file, causing a runtime error when the application tries to refresh expired tokens.

**Impact:**
- Users are logged out unexpectedly when tokens expire
- No automatic token refresh functionality
- Poor user experience with frequent login requirements

**Root Cause:**
Missing implementation of token refresh functionality in the authentication service.

**Fix:**
Added the missing `refreshToken` method to the auth service:
- Proper error handling for refresh failures
- Integration with existing API structure
- Consistent error messaging in Turkish
- Proper TypeScript typing

**Files Modified:**
- Modified: `src/lib/auth-service.ts`

### Bug 3: updatePatient service fails silently (Logic Error)

**File:** `src/app/(main)/dashboard/patients/_services/patient-service.ts`
**Severity:** Medium
**Type:** Logic Error

**Description:**
The `updatePatient` function doesn't check if the HTTP response is successful (`res.ok`), which causes the function to fail silently when the API returns an error. This leads to data inconsistency and poor user experience.

**Impact:**
- Users aren't notified when patient updates fail
- Data inconsistency between frontend and backend
- Poor user experience with misleading success messages
- Silent failures make debugging difficult

**Root Cause:**
Missing error handling for HTTP response status codes in the patient service.

**Fix:**
Added proper error handling to the `updatePatient` function:
- Check for HTTP response status (`res.ok`)
- Parse error messages from API responses
- Throw meaningful error messages
- Return parsed JSON response on success

**Files Modified:**
- Modified: `src/app/(main)/dashboard/patients/_services/patient-service.ts`

## Summary

All three bugs have been successfully fixed:

1. **Compilation Error** - Fixed by creating the missing token-service.ts file
2. **Runtime Error** - Fixed by adding the missing refreshToken method
3. **Logic Error** - Fixed by adding proper error handling to updatePatient

These fixes improve:
- Application stability and reliability
- User experience through proper error handling
- Token management and authentication flow
- Data consistency between frontend and backend

The application should now compile successfully and handle authentication flows properly without silent failures.
